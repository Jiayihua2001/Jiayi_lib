# This is the instruction of how to run gnrs for dimer in cocrystal csp.



## 1. First construct the gnrs work directory: 

File preparation: 1.mol.in (geometry.in for your asymmetric unit,which can be generate by Find_dimers code,i may include this to the workflow later ) ; 2.exp_geometry.in (exp_xtal structures that should be relaxed first) 3.ui.conf (uncomment rigid press , generation setting as same as "crystal") 4.submit.sh 

        1.For now, we must extract mol.in manually or use manny's code ; 
        2.for other 3 files. Please first construc a Cocrystal_gnrs file: attach submit_relax.in ,submit_gnrs.in,ui.conf, write_control.py, write_gnrs_dir.py, each cocrystal has a dir ,with cif in it.    
        3.hen run write_gnrs_dir.py. 
        4.change the setting of ui.conf carefully.   (Z,sg)  
        5.copy the dir to gnrs

## 2. go to gnrs repo,genarris_master.py --only generation

    run dimer_gnrs_submit.py in lib env

    #if n_mol != n_1 +n_2 , assign  "residues" in dimer_gnrs_submit.py. ("residues" is the number of unique mol in your input struc)

##3 . go to gnrs repo , --add rigid press module 
    run dimer_restart.py
